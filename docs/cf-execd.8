and work as a class-based clock for scheduling.

is a self-healing configuration and change management based system. You can think of.B cfengine
as a very high level language, much higher level than Perl or shell. Asingle statement is called a promise, and compliance can result in many hundreds of filesbeing created, or the permissions of many hundreds offiles being set. The idea of .B cfengine
is to create a one or more sets of configuration files which willclassify and describe the setup of every host in a network.
