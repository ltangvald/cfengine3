    <h1>Modus operandi</h1>

<h2>Ordering</h2>

Promises can be simultaneous or given in a particular order. The ordering
is defined below.

repeat: 
 Enable
 Garbage collection
 Resource Creation
 Resouce Modification
until done

Interfaces # enable communication
Process_stop
Signals    # garbage
 kill etc

Files:

 rename
 Tidy      # garbage
 Create|Copy
 Permissions
 Edit

Process_start (we don't say anything about how long it will last? - timeout)

Mount (could depend on processes)


<h2>Relationships</h2>

A line/text item is a property of a file's state (present)

A process is a property of an executable's state (running)

A signal is sent to a PID - this is a raw resource
A restart command is sent to a service name. This is a wrapping of a process/file association. bundle it.

Restart should be a body

body start name

{
start_command => "";

}
