    <h1>Convergence and Forced Operations</h1>


Cfengine is about convergence to a stable state. The state of the system should 
normally be at a fixed point, or else it should be returned to a fixed point.

Occasionally changes in dependencies lead us to force changes, e.g. kill and
restart a daemon. 

<pre>
commands:

    "Stop command";
    "Start command";
</pre>
or
<pre>
processes:

    "myprocess" signal => "term";

commands:

    "start command";
</pre>

The problem with these commands is that they are not "guarded" (in the sense of Dijkstra's
guarded commands). Such a command is not a convergent change unless it is qualified by a
guarding class.

e.g.

<pre>
processes:

  change_in_dependency::

    "myprocess" signal => "term";


commands:

  change_in_dependency::

    "start command"
</pre>
or
<pre>
execution:

 change_in_dependency::

    "Stop command";
    "Start command";
</pre>
or even
<pre>
processes:

  change_in_dependency::

    "myprocess" 
        signal => "term"
        # define newclass ;


commands:

  new_class::

    "start command"
</pre>
