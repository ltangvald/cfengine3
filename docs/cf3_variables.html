    <h1>Variables in cfengine 3</h1>

Here is an important distinction.

All variables are defined in bundles, because a variable assignment is a promise
for a container to hold a value.

There are no variable declarations in bodies, so the following

email => "mark@cfengine.com";

is not a variable declaration, but represents the setting of a static attribute
email to a value. If you want to think of this as a reserved variable that is okay,
but you cannot use the value of this in an expression.
