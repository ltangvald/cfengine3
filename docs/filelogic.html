    <h1>File handling in cfengine 3</h1>


<p>
File handling in cfengine 3 is more integrated than in cfengine 3.
This helps both the logic and the efficiency of implementation.  File
handling is now more powerful, and uses regular expressions everywhere
for pattern matching. The old "wildcard" expressions * and ?  are
deprecated, and everything is based consistently on POSIX extended
regular expressions.

<p>
There is a natural ordering in file processing that obviates the need
for the actionsequence. The trick of using multiple actionsequence
items with different classes, e.g.

<pre>
 actionsequence = ( ... files.one  ..  files.two )
</pre>

can now be handled more elegantly using bundles. The natural ordering 
uses that fact that some operations are mutually exclusive and that
some operations do not make sense in reverse order. For example,
editing a file and then copying onto it would be nonsense.
Similarly, you cannot both remove a file and rename it.

<h2>File copying</h2>

One of the first things you will notice is that copying is now "backwards".
Instead of the default object being source and the option being the destination,
in cfengine 3 the destination is paramount and the source is an option.
This is because the model fo voluntary cooperation tells us that it is the
object that is changed which is the agent making the promise. One cannot
force change onto a destination with cfengine, one can only invite change from
a source.

<h2>Normal ordering</h2>

<pre>
Delete-create (normal ordering) makes sense
Create-delete does not
</pre>
<p>
The diagram below shows the ordering. Notice that the same ordering
applies regardless of file type (plain-file or directory).

<pre>
 for each file promise-object
    {
    if (depth_search) 

      do 
        DepthSearch (HandleLeaf)
      else 
        (HandleLeaf)
      done
    }

 HandleLeaf()
   {
   Does leaf-file exist?

     NO:  create
     YES: rename,delete,touch, 

     do
      for all servers in {localhost, @(servers)}
         {
         if (server-will-provide)
            do
              if (depth_search)
                 embedded source-depth-search (use file source)
                 break
              else
                 (use file source)
                 break
              done
            done
         }
     done
      
   Do all links (always local)

   Check Permissions

   Do edits
   }
</pre>

<h2>Depth searches (recursion) and path matches</h2>

In cfengine 2 there was the concept of recursion during file
searches. Recursion is now called "depth-search". 

In addition, in both cfengine 2 and 3 it was possible to specify
wildcards in the base-path for this search. e.g.

<pre> 
      Cfengine 2               Cfengine 3

/one/*/two/thr*/four    /one/.*/two/thr.*/four
</pre>

When we talk about a depth search it refers to a search which starts
from the one or more matched base-paths.

<p>
Promise theory tells us that there are two distinct kinds of depth
search:

<ul>
<li>A local search over promiser agents.
<li>A remote search over provider agents.
</ul>

It is the destination or resulting files that all promises in
cfengine, not the source. That is due to voluntary cooperation,
i.e. because we never push files, only pull.

<p>
When we are copying or linking to a source, it is the search over the
remote source that drives the content of a promise. In general, the
sources are on a different device to the images that make the
promises.  For all other promises, we search over existing local
objects.

<p>
If we specify depth search together with copy of a directory, then the
implied remote source search is assumed, and it is made after the
search over local objects. Since this could lead to confusion a
warning is issued. In general it is not recommended to mix searches
without a full understanding of the consequences, but this might
occasionally be useful, e.g.  tidy and then copy.

This would not be a convergent operation however.

<p>
Depth search is not allowed with editfiles promises.


<h2>File editing in cfengine 3</h2>

Cfengine 2 assumed that all files were line-edited, because it was
based on Unix traditions. Since then many new file formats have
emerged, including XML.  Cfengine 3 opens up the possibiltiy for
multiple models of file editing. Line based editing is still present and
is both much simplified and much more powerful than previously.

<p>
File editing is not just a single kind of promise but a whole range of
"promises within files". It is therefore not merely a body to a single
promise but a bundle of sub-promises. After all, inside each file is a new
world of objects that can make promises, quite separate from files' external
attributes.

<p>
A typical file editing stanza has the elements in the following
example.


<pre>
######################################################################
#
# File editing
#
######################################################################


body common control

{
version => "1.2.3";
bundlesequence  => { "outerbundle"  };
}

########################################################

bundle agent outerbundle

{
files:

  "/home/mark/tmp/cf3_test"

       create    => "true",            # Like autocreate in cf2
       edit_line => inner_bundle;
}

########################################################

bundle edit_line inner_bundle
  {
  vars:

   "edit_variable" string => "private edit variable"; 
  
  replace_patterns:

   # replace shell comments with C comments

   "#(.*)"

      replace_with => C_comment,
     select_region => MySection("New section");

  }

########################################
# Bodies for the library ...
########################################

body replace_with C_comment

{
replace_value => "/* $(1) */"; # backreference 0
occurrences => "all";          # first, last all
}

########################################################

body select_region MySection(x)

{
select_start => "\[$(x)\]";
select_end => "\[.*\]";
}

</pre>


There are several things to notice:

<ul>
<li> The line-editing promises are all convergent promises about patterns within
the file. They have bodies, just like other attributes do and these allow us to make
simple templates about file editing while extending the power of the basic primitives.

<li> All pattern matching is through perl compatible regular expressions
<li> Editing takes place within a marked region (which default to the whole file).
<li> Search/replace functions now allow back-references
<li> The line edit model now contains a column model for dealing with tabular files such
as Unix passwd and group files. We can now apply powerful convergent editing operations
to single fields inside a table, to append, order and delete items from lists inside fields.
</ul>

In the example above, back references are used to allow conversion of comments from shell-style
to C-style.
