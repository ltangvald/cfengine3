    <h1>Promises</h1>


Each statement is a promise

- the statement of what is promised (type, object and constraints)
- the actions taken to keep the promise (at what times?)
- the outcome of the actions

Each promise type can be desribed in these terms.

Is it convergent? ie. does the repetition of the promise-keeping action always lead to a
stable result? Alternatively can action be avoided if the promise is already kept?

Some promises involve always acting. These are convergent in the sense that the
activity itself is the desired end-state behaviour.
