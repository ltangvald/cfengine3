.SH NAME
cf-know - cfengine's knowledge agent

.SH SYNOPSIS:

 cf-know [options]

.SH DESCRIPTION:

The knowledge management agent is capable of building
and analysing a semantic knowledge network. It can
configure a relational database to contain an ISO
standard topic map and permit regular-expression based
searching of the map. Analysis of the semantic network
can be performed providing graphical output of the data,
and cf-know can assemble and converge the reference manual
for the current version of the Cfengine software.
.B cfengine
is a self-healing configuration and change management based system. You can think of.B cfengine
as a very high level language, much higher level than Perl or shell. Asingle statement is called a promise, and compliance can result in many hundreds of filesbeing created, or the permissions of many hundreds offiles being set. The idea of .B cfengine
is to create a one or more sets of configuration files which willclassify and describe the setup of every host in a network.
