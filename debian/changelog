cfengine3 (3.9.1-4.1ubuntu1) zesty; urgency=medium

  * d/patches: Dropped patch for building with ssl 1.1
    Zesty is still on 1.0.2g, so the patch causes build failures.
  * d/control: Changed build-dep on ssl from 1.1 to 1.0.2g
  * d/patches: Disable hanging testcase tls_generic_test
    The testcase is also disabled in Debian as part of the ssl 1.1 patch.
