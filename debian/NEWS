cfengine3 (3.6.2-1) unstable; urgency=low
  
  Since this version, cfengine3 will no longer use /etc/cfengine3 as
  repository for its statefiles that are usually received from the policy hub.

  These files are internal files and are not supposed to be edited.

  A postinst script will take care of moving what is contained in
  /etc/cfengine3 to /var/lib/cfengine3/inputs.
