# This is a promise/cfengine version of the Linear Topic Map language
# Topics are independent abstract entities which make "use-promise" associations.
# We can assume that all topics offer their info freely to all other topics.
#
# Documents/Occurrences lie outside of a topic map in the substrate, but this
# is where promises live. Documents can make promises about their content
# and type. These supplement the topic map.
